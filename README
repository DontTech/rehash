NAME
    README - Rehash ("Revised and Enhanced Homebrewed Automatic Storytelling Homepage")

DESCRIPTION
    Rehash is a fork of the last open-source release of Slash, which was
    the basis of basis of slashdot.org. Rehash is a partial rewrite of Slash
    to increase functionality, improve usabilitiy, and an incremental port
    to modern versions of Apache, perl, and mod_perl. It is designed for high
    relaibility and scalability, with intergrated support for MySQL cluster,
    multi-frontend support, and a strong adherence to the MVC development
    methodology, clearly abstracting user-facing code from backend management.

    In addition, rehash is designed to be fast, flexible, and highly scalable
    and should scale to almost any load put to it. Furthermore, with support
    for AppArmor, parameter filtering, and query hardening, rehash is resistant
    to both SQL exploitation, and server compromise through the frontend. As
    always, efforts continue to improve this wherever possible. As for proof of
    its robustness, rehash powers soylentnews.org, and its ancestor powered
    slashdot.org (which is one heck of a torture test).

    Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Rehash,
    Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
    the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.

    See INSTALL for information about installing Rehash, including hardware
    and software requirements. Read that document carefully, and follow the
    instructions as precisely as possible.

    Also see INSTALL for information on upgrading from previous versions of
    Slash.

    As noted in the FAQ, please send any bug reports, and subscribe to
    mailing lists, at Rehash's github page.

DOCUMENTATION
    The .pod documentation included with Rehash can be read with the
    "perldoc" program, included with perl, or translated using one of the
    many "pod2*" translators.

    The documentation is also available online on the Slash FAQ.

    Template Toolkit (version 2)
        For more information on how to write templates, see the Template
        Toolkit site.

        http://www.template-toolkit.org/

    RSS For more information on RSS 1.0, and the RSS Slash module.

    Installation
        The details on how to install, and upgrade, Rehash.

        INSTALL

    API The details of the API available in Rehash.

                perldoc Slash
                perldoc Slash::Utility
                perldoc Slash::Display
                perldoc Slash::DB

        The modules represent the bulk of the public API of Slash. The other
        Slash modules have embedded POD to be read with perldoc, too. Some
        of the documentation here is woefully incomplete.

                use Source 'Luke';

        applies to rehash.
