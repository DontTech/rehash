The revised Search plugin requires Sphinx to generate search results for
rehash. An example configuration is provided in sphinx.conf; you'll have
to modify this to include the database username and password as it does not
hook into the Perl DBIx::Password mechanism; the sphinx user should only
have select status to reduce attack surface, though this is not *strictly*
required.

Rehash uses Sphinx's native API, the MySQL protocol frontend is not required

When setting up sphinx, you need to setup a crontab to run build the indexes,
running every few minutes, something like the following should work

$SPHINX/bin/indexer --all --rotate -c *path_to_sphinx.conf*

Currently there is no direct intergration with slashd for this, though that
would likely be a worthwhile update to help simplify setup and maintence.
